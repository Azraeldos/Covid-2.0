            <h2>How does it spread?</h2>
            <p>Covid-19 primarily spreads through infected droplets transmitted through the air and surfaces. A common way Covid-19 transmits is through contaminated public surfaces such as handrails, door handles, and even handshakes. When individuals do not wear masks in public they increase their likelihood of exposure through infected droplets produced by infected individuals.</p>
