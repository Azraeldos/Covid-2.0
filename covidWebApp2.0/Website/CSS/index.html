          <h2>How does your age affect you?</h2>
        <p>Age plays a key role in the human body's response to Covid-19. Elderly individuals are the more susceptible to death caused Covid-19 due to having a weaker immune system. While younger individuals are more likely to survive they are just as susceptible to death due how quickly Covid-19 attacks the immune system.</p>

          <img src="images/Pictures for Covid app/Rvalue.png" alt="Month R-value for Covid. /excel graph"/>
          <h2>What is an R value?</h2>
          <p>R value stands for Reproduction and it is in relation to how fast something spreads. In this example the R value is being measured to help predict how contagious Covid-19 has been. When the R value reaches 1.00 then an outbreak has occurred meaning the amount of cases of Covid-19 are exponential in the area.</p>

      <h2>Confirmed cases of Covid-19 - September/October</h2>
      <p>Keeping track of Covid-19 cases in your area allows you to be more prepared for any possible outbreaks. The line chart above shows the number of positive Covid-19 cases in the San Bernardino area. While positive cases of Covid-19 may be low it is important to remember that the R value plays a key role in determining how fast an outbreak can occur.</p>
