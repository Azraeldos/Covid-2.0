          <h2>How does your age affect you?</h2>
        <p>Age plays a key role in the human body's response to Covid-19. Elderly individuals are the more susceptible to death caused Covid-19 due to having a weaker immune system. While younger individuals are more likely to survive they are just as susceptible to death due how quickly Covid-19 attacks the immune system.</p>

          <p>R value stands for Reproduction and it is in relation to how fast something spreads. In this example the R value is being measured to help predict how contagious Covid-19 has been. When the R value reaches 1.00 then an outbreak has occurred meaning the amount of cases of Covid-19 are exponential in the area.</p>

      <h2>What is Covid-19?</h2>
      <p>Covid-19 is a deadly disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2. It can be contagious and spread quickly depending on how quick the public are able to adapt to precautions. It is primarily transmitted through infected individuals droplets caused by sneezing and coughing. While symptoms may be similar to the common flu, Covid-19 can quickly overcome the body’s immune system leading to death.

        <h2>How to protect yourself</h2>
        <p>To protect yourself and others from Covid-19 individuals are recommended to wear a mask in public to protect from infected droplets and reduce spread. Individuals should also wash their hands frequently as well as schedule an appointment for vaccination. In addition, social distancing is recommended to help reduce spread through infected droplets in the air.</p>

            <h2>How does it spread?</h2>
            <p>Covid-19 primarily spreads through infected droplets transmitted through the air and surfaces. A common way Covid-19 transmits is through contaminated public surfaces such as handrails, door handles, and even handshakes. When individuals do not wear masks in public they increase their likelihood of exposure through infected droplets produced by infected individuals.</p>

          <h2>Importance of Testing</h2>

          <p>
            Testing for COVID-19 is important because it can help to identify and 
            stop the spread of the virus, even among people who are asymptomatic.
            Asymptomatic people are still able to spread the virus to others.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="column" style="background-color:white;">
          <h2>Types of Tests</h2>
          <p>
            Two main types of COVID-19 tests exist: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 
            tests and antigen tests. PCR tests are more reliable and the type you 
            are most likely to receive at a testing site.
          </p>
          <p>
            A healthcare provider or yourself can collect your sample, which will 
            then be transported to a laboratory for testing. Results are usually 
            available within 3 days.

        </div>
        <div class="column" style="background-color:white;">
          <h2>Should You Get Tested?</h2>
          <p>
            The current recommendation from the CDC is to get tested immediately 
            symptoms are present. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are asymptomatic but have been exposed to COVID-19, wait at
            least 5 full days after your exposure before taking a test.

            A negative COVID-19 test means only that the test did not detect the virus.
            PCR tests are 95% accurate, which means you could still be infected.
            The current FDA guidelines suggest repeating the test after 48 hours for 
            at least three total tests (test 3 times!).
