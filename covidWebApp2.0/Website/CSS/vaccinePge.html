          <h2>Why Get Vaccinated?</h2>
            <p>
              Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is one of the most important 
              things you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones from the 
              virus. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective at preventing 
              serious illness, hospitalization, and death. They have been 
              rigorously tested and monitored, and they are millions of times 
              safer than getting sick with COVID-19.

          <h2>What Vaccinations are Available?</h2>
            <p>
              There are three vaccinations authorized by the FDA. They are the 
              Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax COVID-19 vaccines. The first 
              two are mRNA vaccines and the latter is a protein subunit vaccine.

        <div class="column" style="background-color:white;">
          <h2>Are Vaccines Trustworthy?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes! Although the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were developed
              rapidly, both companies have research mRNA vaccination since 2008 and 
              2010, respectively.

          <h2>What if I can't afford a vaccination?</h2>
            <p>
              Almost all insurance providers will cover the cost of your COVID-19
              vaccine. Although federal funding has ended for COVID-19 vaccination, 
              they are still free to the uninsured if you book through <b>My Turn</b>.
